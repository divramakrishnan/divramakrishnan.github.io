# Process for creation of this website 
I went through these steps to create this site:
1. Firstly, I watched Youtube videos on how to build a website from scratch, and how to edit a template to fit your design goals. Although I heavily considered working from scratch, I decided I wanted to use a pre-existing template when I saw how many adaptable were integrated with GitHub pages from Jekyll. 

2. After choosing the template that I wanted to build my design off of, I built a wireframe that laid out my ideas 

3. Once I built the wireframe, I dove into working with the existing code to change the pages and the features of the site to reflect my designs. I applied the existing knowledge on JavaScript that I had from a course I took in the Spring 2020 semester on data-driven web applications. 

4. I drew graphic art for the site and updated the cover photos of the different projects I linked.
